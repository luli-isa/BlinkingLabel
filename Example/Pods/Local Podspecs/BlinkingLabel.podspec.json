  "description": "BlinkingLabel is a pod about UILabel class for Swift. This tutorial will walk you through creating a pod that allows you to create a UILabel that blinks. We'll call it BlinkingLabel. Do you have a unique take on how to perform certain string manipulations? Do you have a favorite subclass that you wrote for performing a slick animation on a UIView? Specific utility code like this is a great example of what can be turned into a pod. Itâ€™s often already well-factored and decoupled from other existing code bases",
