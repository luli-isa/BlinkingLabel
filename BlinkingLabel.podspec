# This description is used to generate tags and improve search results.
#   * Think: What does it do? Why did you write it? What is the focus?
#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
#   * Write the description between the DESC delimiters below.
#   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!  
  s.description      = "BlinkingLabel is a pod about UILabel class for Swift. This tutorial will walk you through creating a pod that allows you to create a UILabel that blinks. We'll call it BlinkingLabel. Do you have a unique take on how to perform certain string manipulations? Do you have a favorite subclass that you wrote for performing a slick animation on a UIView? Specific utility code like this is a great example of what can be turned into a pod. Itâ€™s often already well-factored and decoupled from other existing code bases"
